# Check if your gitignore has the right files before pushing your project

# Git Structure:

- master branch with the final version of the code, after the dev branch says it is ok to push, this only merges the dev branch, we never delete this branch
- development branch which merges every feature developed, we never delete this branch
- any feature to be added should be developed in a specific branch, we delete these branches after the feature or bugfix is finished.
- kotlin branches, the same branches and structure as above but in kotlin and not java.

# Todo
add the base project to dev folder
check if it works ok, and merge it to the main branch
